- No artifacts
- Less code is better than more code
- No fallback mechanisms — they hide real failures
- Rewrite existing components over adding new ones
- Flag obsolete files to keep the codebase lightweight
- Avoid race conditions at all costs
- Take your time to ultrathink when on extended thinking mode — thinking is cheaper than fixing bugs
- Add comments only when necessary — the code should speak for itself
- Always add meaningful logs — but only where it brings value
- Always do production ready code
- Code in a modular way to promote collaboration between agents - Adding features must not break the rest of the system

These rules aim to maintain a clean, modular and maintainable codebase while promoting effective collaboration between different agents and developers. Don't write/change any code until you're very confident (95% or more) in what needs to be done. If unclear, ask for more info.
